# About the Electronic

A small bit of electronic hacking is required for now. You need to power the XL-320 motors with 7.5V and the MX-28 with 12V.

The cables between motors have two purposes:

* Distribute alimentation to each motor
* Convey messages to each motor (ordering them to move or asking them for sensors values)

Thus the alimentation should be added between the USB2AX (that deals with communication aspects) and the motors.
To this end simply create the following card that can power both type of motors.

But you need an account, you can create an account in this [link](http://www.circuitmaker.com/thank-you/#download), then you have access to project.

If you have your own PCB designer for make circuits, you can follow this schematic:
